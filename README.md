## Overview

Track your daily habits with the satisfying visual feedback of GitHub's contribution graph. Focus on one habit at a time, commit when you complete it, and watch your streak grow.

## Core Features

### 🎯 Single Habit Focus
- Add one habit to develop at a time
- Examples: "Read 20 pages", "Exercise 30 min", "Meditate 10 min"
- Prevents overwhelm, builds focus

### ✅ Daily Commits
- Mark habit as complete for today
- Creates a "commit" with timestamp
- Builds your personal contribution graph

### 📊 Visual Progress
- GitHub-style green squares for each day
- Darker green = completed, light gray = missed
- See patterns and streaks at a glance

### 📈 Streak Tracking
- Current streak counter
- Longest streak record
- Completion percentage

## Basic Workflow

1. **Set Habit**: Define one clear, actionable habit
2. **Daily Check**: Did you do it today?
3. **Commit**: Mark complete and see your square turn green
4. **Build Streak**: Keep the momentum going
5. **Review**: See your progress over time

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multiple habits (one at a time mastery first)
- [ ] Export streaks as images
- [ ] Reminder notifications

## Philosophy

> "Success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out." - Robert Collier

Start small, stay consistent, build momentum. One habit, one day, one commit at a time.
